# COVID-discussion-analysis

This data mining analysis delves into the rich tapestry of COVID-related discussions within the United States on the Twitter platform. With a focus on discussions surrounding isolation, disinfectants, vaccines, and medicine, the study reveals a diverse and evolving landscape of discourse. Notably, the findings suggest that states are not clustered primarily by geographical proximity, as demonstrated by the optimal two-cluster identification. Moreover, discussions around vaccines and medicine, particularly the vaccine, stand out as dominant themes, presenting essential insights for public health strategies and communication efforts tailored to specific states and regions.

The analysis has yielded several key findings. Notably, the state-level discussions of COVID-related topics exhibit variations, with a striking emphasis on vaccines and medicine, particularly the vaccine, while discussions about isolation and disinfectants are relatively subdued. The clustering techniques, K-means, and spectral clustering, consistently identify 2 as the optimal number of clusters to represent state-level discussions. This finding suggests that states are not grouped primarily based on geographical proximity but rather by their relative similarity in discussing the selected topics. These results offer insights into the diverse and evolving nature of COVID-related discourse across states, which could have implications for public health strategies and messaging.
Among the variables examined, the average topic similarity values for vaccines and medicine appear to be the most explanatory in the analysis. States with high average similarity values in these topics stand out distinctly from those with lower values. While the average similarity values for isolation and disinfectants provide valuable information, their impact on explaining the outcomes is less pronounced. To further enhance the analysis, advanced NLP techniques, consideration of external variables like vaccination rates or COVID-19 case data, hypothesis testing, and time-series analysis could be incorporated. Additionally, addressing potential causal inference problems, such as selection bias, simultaneity, and omitted variable bias, would necessitate a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the discussions and the use of sophisticated causal inference methods if establishing causal relationships is a priority.
